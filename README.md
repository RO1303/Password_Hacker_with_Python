This is the *Password Hacker with Python* project I made myself.


<p>All sorts of creatures lurk around the Internet, including trolls, pirates, miners – and hackers. In this project, you're going to step into the shoes of a hacker, tasked with infiltrating a secret server — password unknown. Your mission is to create a Python program that can crack the password swiftly. Learn how hacking works and create a complex application where you will work on iterators and generators, itertools and time module. You will practice concepts frequently tested in technical interviews at top tech companies.</p>
